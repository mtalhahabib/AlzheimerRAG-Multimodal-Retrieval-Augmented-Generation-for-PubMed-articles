Abstract:
Astaxanthin derived from natural sources has excellent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, and it is currently being widely researched as a neuroprotectant. However, astaxanthin possesses low oral bioavailability, and thus, astaxanthin extract from Haematococcus pluvialis was formulated into a nanoemulsion to improve its bioavailability and administered to Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like rats to study its possible neuroprotective benefits. Astaxanthin nanoemulsion was administered orally once a day for 28 days to streptozotocin (STZ)-induced AD rats at concentrations of 160, 320, and 640&#xa0;mg/kg of body weight (bw) and subsequently assessed for cognitive function using behavioral assessments. Brain samples were collected for the assessment of AD biomarkers. Astaxanthin nanoemulsion at a dosage of 640&#xa0;mg/kg bw significantly improved spatial learning, spatial memory, and recognition memory against STZ-AD rats. At 320 and 640&#xa0;mg/kg bw, astaxanthin nanoemulsion significantly reduced levels of hippocampus synaptosomal amyloid beta and paired-helical fibrillary tau protein while increasing neuron survival. Additionally, astaxanthin nanoemulsion at 640&#xa0;mg/kg bw significantly increased acetylcholine levels in the hippocampus and cerebellum. Astaxanthin nanoemulsion at all treatment dosages significantly reduced malondialdehyde, a lipid peroxidation product, and neuroinflammatory mediators (GFAP and TNF-&#x3b1;). Astaxanthin nanoemulsion supplementation has the potential to improve cognitive function and synaptic function by lowering amyloid beta and tau levels, as well as preserve neuron integrity by reducing neuroinflammation and lipid peroxidation, indicating that it may be able to treat some of the underlying causes of AD.&#xa9; 2025.
