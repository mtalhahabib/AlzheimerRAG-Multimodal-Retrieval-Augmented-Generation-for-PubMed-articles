Abstract:
This study investigates the impact of combined special education and occupational therapy intervention on cognitive functions in Alzheimer's patients. Specifically, it evaluates changes measured by the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE-R) after six months compared to a control group receiving standard care. A longitudinal, controlled experiment was conducted with random assignment to experimental and control groups. The experimental group underwent three weekly interventions of 45-50&#xa0;min over eight months in 2021. Cognitive functions were periodically assessed using ACE-R. Power analysis determined a sample size of 128 participants for adequate statistical power; the study included 60 participants (30 per group). Data were analyzed using non-parametric methods due to non-normal data distribution. The experimental group showed significant improvement in ACE-R scores compared to the control group. The mean difference in scores was 10.27 points (SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.83) for the experimental group, indicating improved cognitive function, while the control group showed a mean decrease of 5.67 points (SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.06). Statistical analysis confirmed significant differences between groups at both interim and final assessments (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). The combined special education and occupational therapy intervention led to significant cognitive improvements in Alzheimer's patients compared to standard care. The study supports the efficacy of such interventions in enhancing cognitive functions, as evidenced by the substantial score increases in the experimental group.&#xa9; 2025. The Author(s).
