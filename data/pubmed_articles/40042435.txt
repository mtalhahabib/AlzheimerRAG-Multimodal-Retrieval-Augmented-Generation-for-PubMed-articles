Abstract:
Amyloid-&#x3b2; (A&#x3b2;) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers are now established tools in the diagnostic workup of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and their use is anticipated to increase with the introduction of new disease-modifying therapies. Although these biomarkers are comparable alternatives in research settings to determine A&#x3b2; status, biomarker testing in clinical practice requires careful consideration of the strengths and limitations of each modality, as well as the specific clinical context, to identify which test is best suited for each patient. This article provides a comprehensive review of the pathologic processes reflected by A&#x3b2;-PET and CSF biomarkers, their performance, and their current and future applications and contexts of use. The primary aim is to assist clinicians in making better-informed decisions about the suitability of each biomarker in different clinical situations, thereby reducing the risk of misdiagnosis or incorrect interpretation of biomarker results. HIGHLIGHTS: Recent advances have positioned A&#x3b2; PET and CSF biomarkers as pivotal in AD diagnosis. It is crucial to understand the differences in the clinical use of these biomarkers. A team of experts reviewed the state of A&#x3b2; PET and CSF markers in clinical settings. Differential features in the clinical application of these biomarkers were reviewed. We discussed the role of A&#x3b2; PET and CSF in the context of novel plasma biomarkers.&#xa9; 2025 The Author(s).
