Abstract:
Dementia is a neurological syndrome marked by cognitive decline. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are the common forms of dementia, each with distinct progression patterns. Early and accurate diagnosis of dementia cases (AD and FTD) is crucial for effective medical care, as both conditions have similar early-symptoms. EEG, a non-invasive tool for recording brain activity, has shown potential in distinguishing AD from FTD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).This study aims to develop a deep learning-based classification system for dementia by analyzing EEG derived scout time-series signals from deep brain regions, specifically the hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamus. Scout time series extracted via the standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) technique are utilized. The time series is converted to image representations using continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and fed as input to deep learning models. Two high-density EEG datasets are utilized to validate the efficacy of the proposed method: the online BrainLat dataset (128 channels, comprising 16 AD, 13 FTD, and 19 healthy controls (HC)) and the in-house IITD-AIIA dataset (64 channels, including subjects with 10 AD, 9 MCI, and 8 HC). Different classification strategies and classifier combinations have been utilized for the accurate mapping of classes in both data sets.The best results were achieved using a product of probabilities from classifiers for left and right subcortical regions in conjunction with the DenseNet model architecture. It yield accuracies of 94.17 % and 77.72 % on the BrainLat and IITD-AIIA datasets, respectively.The results highlight that the image representation-based deep learning approach has the potential to differentiate various stages of dementia. It pave the way for more accurate and early diagnosis, which is crucial for the effective treatment and management of debilitating conditions.&#xa9; 2025. The Author(s).
