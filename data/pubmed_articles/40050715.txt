Abstract:
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is expected to have a significant impact on resource use and economic consequences along with population aging. This study aims to investigate the annual economic burden of Alzheimer's disease along with underlying cost drivers.Patients with AD aged 65 and above accompanied with primary caregivers were recruited in 6 tertiary care hospitals. A structured interview was conducted to collect sociodemographic, clinical and resource use information using an adapted questionnaire. Direct medical cost, direct non-medical cost and indirect cost were annualised and categorised by severity level. Generalised linear models were applied to investigate predictors of costs.Among 135 patient-caregiver dyads, the annual economic burden of AD from a societal perspective was USD 8618.83&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;USD 6740.79 per capita. The societal cost of severe AD patients (USD11943.19&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;USD6954.17) almost doubled those in mild AD (USD6281.10&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;USD6879.83). IDC was the primary cost driver (77.7%) which represented the impact of productivity loss due to informal care. Besides disease severity, time spent in informal care, caregivers' employment and use of special accommodation were predictors of AD cost. This neurodegenerative disorder is estimated to impose a burden of USD1.9 billion in 2022, which represents 0.47% of Malaysia's GDP.This study provided real-world empirical cost estimates of AD burden in Malaysia. Informal care is a significant contributor to the societal cost of AD. Optimal healthcare resource allocation is essential in the decision making of healthcare stakeholders to address rising demands.&#xa9; 2025. The Author(s).
