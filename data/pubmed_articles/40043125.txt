Abstract:
Elucidating the downstream impact of exogenous hormones on the aging brain will have far-reaching consequences for understanding why Alzheimer's disease (AD) predominates in women almost twofold over men. We tested the extent to which menopausal hormone therapy (HT) use is associated with later-life amyloid-&#x3b2; (A&#x3b2;) and tau accumulation using PET on N&#xa0;=&#xa0;146 baseline clinically normal women, aged 51 to 89 years. Women were scanned over a 4.5-year (SD, 2.1; range, 1.3 to 10.4) and 3.5-year (SD, 1.5; range, 1.2 to 8.1) period for A&#x3b2; and tau, respectively, ~14 years after the initiation of HT. In older women (aged &gt;70 years), HT users exhibited faster regional tau accumulation relative to non-users, localized to the entorhinal cortex and the inferior temporal and fusiform gyri, with an indirect effect of HT on cognitive decline through regional tau accumulation. In younger women (aged &lt;70 years), HT associations with tau accumulation were negligible. Findings are relevant for optimizing menopausal treatment guidelines.
