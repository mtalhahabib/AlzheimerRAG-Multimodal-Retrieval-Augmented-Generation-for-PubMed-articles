Abstract:
Tinospora cordifolia has been used for thousands of years to treat various health conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases. The study aimed to elucidate the mechanism of action and protein targets of T. cordifolia in the context of Alzheimer's disease through untargeted metabolomics and network pharmacology. LC-MS/MS analysis resulted in 1186 metabolites, including known bioactive compounds such as liquiritin, Plastoquinone 3, and Shoyuflavone A, to name a few. The network pharmacology analysis highlighted the metabolite-protein interaction with the enrichment of 591 human proteins, including neurotransmitter receptors and other regulatory proteins. Pathway analysis highlighted the enrichment of cAMP, mTOR, MAPK, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways along with cholinergic, dopaminergic, serotonergic, glutamatergic synapse, and apoptosis. The docking results suggest that T. cordifolia metabolites could interact with key Alzheimer's disease targets BACE1 and MAO-B, suggesting its role in neuroprotection. These findings provide insights into the biochemical pathways underlying T. cordifolia's therapeutic effects and provides a foundation for future exploration of T. cordifolia in the context of translational research.&#xa9; 2025.
