Abstract:
Using the phase synchronization of EEG signals, two different phases, PLI and PLV, were used to construct brain network analysis and graph convolutional neural network, respectively, to achieve automatic identification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to assist in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.In this paper, we selected outpatients (16 AD subjects, 20 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects and 21 healthy control (HC) subjects) from the outpatient clinic of Yangpu Mental Health Center in Shanghai, China, from January 2023 to December 2023, and collected resting-state EEG data. To collect resting-state EEG data, each patient was asked to sit down with eyes closed for 5 min. Firstly, the acquired EEG data were preprocessed to extract the data in the &#x3b1;-band at 8-13 Hz; secondly, the phase lag index (PLI) and phase-locked value (PLV) were used to construct the brain functional network, and the brain functional connectivity map was visualized by brain functional connectivity analysis. Finally, the constructed PLI and PLV were input into the graph convolutional neural network (GCN) model as node features for training and classification, respectively.Healthy controls had relatively strong mean brain functional connectivity in the PLV brain network compared to AD and MCI patients. MCI patients showed lower mean brain functional connectivity in the brain network of PLI, while all three groups showed significant differences in brain functional connectivity between parietal and occipital lobes. The GCN model improved classification accuracy by more than 10% compared to using a machine learning classifier. When PLV was used as the nodal feature in the GCN model, the model achieved an average classification accuracy of 77.80% for the three groups of AD, MCI and HC, which was an improvement over the accuracy of choosing raw EEG data and PLI as the nodal feature. The performance of the model was further validated.The experimental results show that the GCN model can effectively identify the graph structure compared with the traditional machine learning model, the GCN-PLV model can better classify AD patients, and the alpha band is proved to be more suitable for AD resting-state EEG by tenfold cross-validation. The brain network map constructed based on PLI and PLV can further capture the local features of EEG signals and the intrinsic functional relationships between brain regions, and the combination of these two models has certain reference value for the diagnosis of AD patients.&#xa9; 2025.
